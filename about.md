ThingsCamp is a shared space for building more inclusive activity around IoT. Behind it is a commitment to growing a diverse audience, exploring wider implications and encouraging creative, varied discussion.

We hope, through events and collaborations, to point a critical lens at connected devices, helping us see beyond the commercial and theoretical perspectives. But ThingsCamp is equally an opportunity to get close to the technology: understanding and exploring it through experimentation and making.
