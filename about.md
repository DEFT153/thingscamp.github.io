ThingsCamp is a series of events, a community and a set of resources designed to promote more inclusive activity around internet-connected devices, or the “Internet of Things”. Behind it is a commitment to growing a diverse audience and encouraging creative, varied discussion.

We work hard to bring together anyone with an interest in what this technology means for them and events typically cover everything from introductory talks to in-depth, hands-on workshops. But whatever your level of experience and understanding you’ll be able to come along, meet new people, engage in interesting discussions and play with technology.
