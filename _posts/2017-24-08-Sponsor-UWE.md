Everyone at ThingsCamp would like to thank [UWE](http://www.uwe.ac.uk/) for their support; as a top level sponsor they’re really helping to make ThingsCamp happen. We’re grateful for their specific support which has enabled us to provide catering, venue and marketing for the event, and for the in-kind contribution of some staff and students whose enthusiasm has been invaluable to initiating the event in Bristol.

UWE Bristol is a University Alliance university with a common mission to make the difference to their cities and regions. They use their experience of providing high quality teaching and research with real world impact to shape higher education and research policy for the benefit of their students and business and civic partners. They innovate together, learn from each other and support every member to transform lives and deliver growth.
