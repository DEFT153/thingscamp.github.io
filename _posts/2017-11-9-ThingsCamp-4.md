On Saturday December 9th ThingsCamp will return to London for its fourth outing and to the Islington offices of [Valtech](https://www.valtech.co.uk/), our generous hosts. We're looking forward to applying all the learning from our previous events to make this ThingsCamp a perfect mix of discussion, tinkering, prototyping, challenging and connecting.

Tickets are free and [available on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/thingscamp-4-tickets-39691765138). With exactly a  month to go we're also looking for additional supporters to help us with equipment, materials, food, drink and anything else that will elevate the ThingsCamp experience even more.
