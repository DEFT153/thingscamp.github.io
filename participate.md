ThingsCamp 5 will come to Birmingham later this year and this time we have TWO events. There's <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/thingscamp-5-tickets-45583660957">a traditional ThingsCamp on Saturday the 16th</a> of June and something <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/thingscamp-5-for-business-tickets-46181131006">a little more business-focused on the 19th</a>. We've learned a huge amount from the previous four ThingsCamps (and our spin-off event during the V&A Digital Design Weekend) and ThingsCamp 5 promises to be our best yet.
