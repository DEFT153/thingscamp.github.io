ThingsCamp 4 comes to London on Saturday, December 9th with the support of [Valtech](http://valtech.co.uk) who are kindly allowing us to take over their Islington space for the day. We've learned a huge amount from the previous three ThingsCamps (and our spin-off event during the V&A Digital Design Weekend) and ThingsCamp 4 promises to be our best yet.

[Get your ticket here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/thingscamp-4-tickets-39691765138).

Our last event was on April 7 and 8th in Bristol; you can see [some of the photos from that here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mistergough/albums/72157679862656462). Previous ThingsCamps took place in Plymouth and [London](http://beyond.place/2016/11/11/thinking-things-through/). If you want to host a ThingsCamp where you're based then [connect with us through this page](http://things.camp/connect/).
